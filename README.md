Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease using Logistic Regression, a popular classification algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset containing patient health metrics and outputs a binary prediction: presence or absence of heart disease.

Dataset

The dataset includes attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Resting blood pressure

Cholesterol level

Fasting blood sugar

Resting electrocardiographic results

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression induced by exercise

Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy

Thalassemia

Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Tools & Technologies

Python (Programming Language)

Pandas and NumPy (Data Manipulation)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning & Logistic Regression)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling

Model Building: Logistic Regression

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC score
